# Identity_and_Access_Management
A beginners look at Identity and Access Management using a room I did on TryHackMe.com

## TryHackMe - Identity and Access Mangement

## Overview
This room covers the fundementals of Identification, Authentication, Authorisation, Accountability, and Identity Management or IAAAID in a beginner friendly way. To help understand these concepts, the hands on activities provides practical knowledge on how to apply security principles to various systems and problems.

## What I learned
1. **RBAC vs ABAC**:
   - Role Based Access control - simplifies access management by grouping permissions into clearly defined roles to effciently manage large scale access.
   - Attribute Based Access Control - assigns permissions based on attributes associated with a user or resource. Examples of attributes would be date, location, or application.

2. **Identity**:
   - How a user is identified in a system and the importance of a unique identifier like a username or id number
  
3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Difference between authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (granting permissions).
   - Common authentication methods: passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and single sign-on (SSO).
     
4. **Accountability**:
   - The importance of logging and monitoring to track user actions for later auditing.
  
5. **Identity Management**:
    - Managing user identities and permissions efficiently within a system.

## Achievements for completing this course.
- Understood and implemented key IAM best practices, such as enforcing MFA in a cloud system. using a simulation.
- Applied the principles of identification, authentication, and authorization in securing a system.
- Reviewed logs to understand user activity and detect unauthorized attempts.
- Understand attacker methodologies related to IAM and implement defenses.
- Gained insights into the principle of least privilege and its importance in securing systems.

## Tools Used 
- Linux command line to review logs
- IAM Platforms provided by TryHackMe

## Conculsion 
This room is particularly valuable for individuals interested in cybersecurity, cloud administration, or anyone responsible for managing user access and identities in IT environments
